# Hi 👋🏽, I'm Jared!

🎼 After graduating from the Electronic Music department of the Conservatory of Amsterdam, I transitioned into the world of Computer Science.

🎓 I studied at Codam Coding College (42 The Network), where I focused mainly on C/C++ in a Linux environment.

💻 Currently, I’m in the process of pursuing a Software Engineering Internship.

🧼 I’m a fan of [clean code](https://github.com/jaredgoedhart/styling/blob/main/README.md). I write code that is readable, easy to understand and self-explanatory.

🏆 I’m always eager to learn and improve my skills, looking for ways to make my code even cleaner and more efficient.

🍃 Outside of coding, I enjoy music production, visiting museums, and sipping on a good cup of tea.
